"Vehicle Registry System in C++ implementing object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and static members. It supports managing various vehicle types via a console menu including Cars, Electric Cars, Flying Cars, Sports Cars, Sedans, and SUVs. Provides features to add, view, and search vehicles."
🚗✨ Vehicle Registry System in C++ ✨🚗

This project demonstrates a comprehensive vehicle management system built using C++ programming, focusing on key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and static members. It includes various vehicle categories such as Cars, Electric Cars, Flying Cars, Sports Cars, Sedans, and SUVs, modeled through a rich class hierarchy showcasing multi-level and multiple inheritance.

The system features a simple console menu interface that allows users to:

Add different types of vehicles with detailed attributes

View all registered vehicles with their unique properties

Search for specific vehicles by their unique ID

This code provides a practical exercise in dynamic memory management, runtime polymorphism, and class design, making it ideal for students and enthusiasts learning advanced C++ OOP concepts. It also includes an extensible architecture that can be further enhanced with features like file storage or GUI integration.
